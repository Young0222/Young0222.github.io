I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Boston Children’s Hospital (the world’s #1 ranked pediatric hospital), a primary teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School working under the mentorship of Prof. [Kaifu Chen](https://dms.hms.harvard.edu/people/kaifu-chen). My research focuses on decoding gene regulatory relationships and reconstructing cellular lineage trajectories using graph-based machine learning and single-cell multi-omics data.

I received my Ph.D. from the [School of Software](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Chaokun Wang](https://wangchaokun.github.io/index.html). Before that, I was a postgraduate student in the [College of Intelligence and Computing](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/) at [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Di Jin](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/jindi/index.htm) and Prof. [Dongxiao He](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/hedongxiao/index.htm).

Research
======
My research focuses on Graph Neural Network (GNN) and its applications. I have developed different methods for enhancing the capability of GNNs or graph contrastive learning from different aspects, including high-quality embedding (ICDE'24, TKDE'24), efficient storage & computation (ICDE'23), and structure-preserving (IJCAI'24).

I am currently interested in leveraging GNNs to solve the challenges in biology.
